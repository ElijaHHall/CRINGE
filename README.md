Tired of getting drunk and texting your friends? Well, this app doesn't solve that problem, it makes it easier! Forget typing and mispelling all those important vocabulary words you learned at the bar with our simple and easy to use app! Simply add your friends numbers and our app will do the rest! We will send a random drunk message to your friends and you can see it too!

## **User Experience**

The link will bring you to a splash page that will direct you to either the sign-up or login page. On the sign-up page you will create your user account and the login page will start your session.  The home page of the app is fairly simple.  Press the button to send random drunk messages to your friends.  You can also view your contacts in the top right modal.

## **Goals**

1. Make app responsive and mobile.
2. Get users able to sign up, sign in, and logout
3. Get Twilio to send texts to users
4. Get text content to be randomized and to send the same message to contacts
5. ALWAYS DEPLOY


## **Stretch Goals**

1. We wanted to implement Google Maps API to send location with text
2. Wanted to make a drink gauge the fills up with the amount of texts sent
3. Pay for a twilio account, right now we only have a free trial and can't have custom phone numbers for users
