#CRINGE

//User Experience\\

Have you ever wanted to automatically text your friends while your drinking?
Well now you can with Cringe!
When you sign up, enter in your friends phone numbers, add the text you want to send them at 2 drinks, 5 drinks, 7 drinks, etc. and Cringe will automatically send them the text. We want the user to enjoy their night (or day) out drinking without the hassle of sending a text to their friends. CRINGE will do that for them. You also won't have to ruin your life, because again, CRINGE will do that for you.
